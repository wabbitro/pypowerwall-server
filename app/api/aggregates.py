Aggregate Data API Endpoints

REST API for querying combined data from multiple Powerwall gateways.
All routes are prefixed with /api/aggregate (configured in main.py).

Routes:
    - GET /api/aggregate/        -> Complete aggregated data (all metrics)
    - GET /api/aggregate/power   -> Power flows only (site, battery, load, solar, grid)
    - GET /api/aggregate/soe     -> Average battery level across all gateways
    - GET /api/aggregate/battery -> Battery capacity and charge information
    - GET /api/aggregate/strings -> Per-gateway solar string data keyed by gateway ID
    - GET /api/aggregate/alerts  -> Per-gateway alert lists keyed by gateway ID
    - GET /api/aggregate/vitals  -> Per-gateway vitals keyed by gateway ID

Use Cases:
    - Dashboard displaying total system capacity
    - Monitoring multiple Powerwall installations as single system
    - Historical data collection for combined systems
    - Load balancing across multiple sites
    - Per-gateway string/alert data without string-name collision
      (e.g. two gateways both report string "A" — keyed by gateway ID they are distinct)

Data Aggregation:
    - Battery percentages are averaged across online gateways
    - Power values (W) are summed across all gateways
    - Capacity values (Wh) are summed across all gateways
    - Only online gateways contribute to aggregates
    - Timestamps reflect most recent update across all gateways

Design Notes:
    - All data comes from cached gateway states (no blocking calls)
    - Returns immediately even if gateways are offline
    - Offline gateways are excluded from calculations
    - num_online field indicates how many gateways contributed
